     * Check the format of TLS PreMasterSecret.

     * To avoid vulnerabilities described by section 7.4.7.1, RFC 5246,
     * treating incorrectly formatted message blocks and/or mismatched
     * version numbers in a manner indistinguishable from correctly
     * formatted RSA blocks.
     *
     * RFC 5246 describes the approach as :
     *
     *  1. Generate a string R of 48 random bytes
     *
     *  2. Decrypt the message to recover the plaintext M
     *
     *  3. If the PKCS#1 padding is not correct, or the length of message
     *     M is not exactly 48 bytes:
     *        pre_master_secret = R
     *     else If ClientHello.client_version &lt;= TLS 1.0, and version
     *     number check is explicitly disabled:
     *        premaster secret = M
     *     else If M[0..1] != ClientHello.client_version:
     *        premaster secret = R
     *     else:
     *        premaster secret = M
     *
     * Note that #2 should have completed before the call to this method.
     *
     * @param  clientVersion the version of the TLS protocol by which the
     *         client wishes to communicate during this session
     * @param  serverVersion the negotiated version of the TLS protocol which
     *         contains the lower of that suggested by the client in the client
     *         hello and the highest supported by the server.
     * @param  encoded the encoded key in its "RAW" encoding format
     * @param  isFailOver whether or not the previous decryption of the
     *         encrypted PreMasterSecret message run into problem
